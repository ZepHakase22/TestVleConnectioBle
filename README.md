# TestVleConnectioBle
Test the connection on different Ble devices using Android.

The example works on API <21 abd API >= 21.
To realize the example we started from </br> https://github.com/joelwass/Android-BLE-Connect-Example </br>
that works only for API >=21 adjusting some minor bugs. For the implementation we used Android Studio 3.0.

## Installation using Android Studio 3.0.

Clone the repository and open in Android Studio. 

## Installation from command line

Under the project directory run 

```
    adb install build/outputs/apk/debug/TestVleBleConnection-debug.apk
```
